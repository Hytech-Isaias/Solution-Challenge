# Enhanced WhatsApp Recruitment Platform - Architecture Diagram

## Current vs. Proposed Architecture

### Current Architecture (Problems)
```
User ──> WhatsApp ──> Meta API ──> Webhook ──> Dispatcher Server ──> AI Agent
                                       │
                                       ▼
                                   Database
```

**Issues:**
- Linear, synchronous processing
- No event tracking or analytics
- No intervention capabilities
- Black box operations

## Service Interaction Flow

### 1. Normal Conversation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Candidate
    participant WA as WhatsApp
    participant WHS as Webhook Service
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant CMS as Conversation Mgmt
    participant MLS as ML/AI Service
    participant SMS as State Mgmt
    participant AS as Analytics
    
    U->>WA: Sends message
    WA->>WHS: Webhook notification
    WHS->>EB: Publish MessageReceived event
    EB->>CMS: Route to conversation handler
    EB->>SMS: Update candidate state
    EB->>AS: Record interaction metrics
    
    CMS->>MLS: Generate AI response
    MLS-->>CMS: AI response
    CMS->>EB: Publish MessageSent event
    EB->>WHS: Send response to WhatsApp
    WHS->>WA: Send message
    WA->>U: Delivers message
```

### 2. Risk Detection & Intervention Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant RSS as Risk Scoring Service
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant NS as Notification Service
    participant R as Recruiter
    participant SLACK as Slack
    
    Note over RSS: Monitors candidate inactivity
    RSS->>RSS: Calculate risk score
    RSS->>EB: Publish CandidateAtRisk event
    EB->>NS: Trigger notification
    NS->>SLACK: Send alert message
    SLACK->>R: Notifies recruiter
    R->>R: Decides to intervene
```

### 3. Operator Takeover Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Recruiter
    participant OI as Operator Interface
    participant OS as Operator Service
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant CMS as Conversation Mgmt
    participant U as Candidate
    
    R->>OI: Requests takeover
    OI->>OS: Initiate takeover
    OS->>EB: Publish OperatorTakeover event
    EB->>CMS: Switch to human mode
    
    R->>OI: Types message
    OI->>OS: Send message
    OS->>EB: Publish OperatorMessage event
    EB->>CMS: Route human message
    CMS->>U: Delivers message via WhatsApp
    
    Note over R: Conversation continues
    R->>OI: Hands back to bot
    OI->>OS: Resume automation
    OS->>EB: Publish ResumeAutomation event
    EB->>CMS: Switch to bot mode
```

## Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

### Business Metrics Dashboard
```yaml
Funnel Metrics:
  - Candidates by stage (real-time)
  - Stage conversion rates
  - Average time in each stage
  - Drop-off points analysis

Risk Management:
  - At-risk candidates count
  - Risk score distribution
  - Intervention success rates
  - Operator response times

Performance Metrics:
  - Message processing latency
  - Event processing throughput
  - System availability
  - API response times
```

### Alert Definitions
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Service down > 1 minute
  - Message processing delay > 30 seconds
  - Database connection failures
  - High error rates (>1%)

Business Alerts:
  - High-value candidate at risk
  - Unusual drop-off spike
  - Operator queue backup
  - Low conversion rate trends

Warning Alerts:
  - High latency (>1 second)
  - Memory usage >80%
  - Disk space <20%
  - Queue length growing
```

## Security & Compliance Framework

### Data Protection
```yaml
Encryption:
  - Data at rest: AES-256
  - Data in transit: TLS 1.3
  - Database: Transparent Data Encryption
  - Message content: End-to-end encryption

Access Controls:
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - API key rotation
  - Session management

Privacy Compliance:
  - GDPR Article 17 (Right to erasure)
  - Data minimization principles
  - Consent management
  - Data retention policies
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
# Namespace organization
namespaces:
  - recruitment-platform-prod
  - recruitment-platform-staging
  - recruitment-platform-dev

# Service mesh (Istio)
service_mesh:
  - mTLS between services
  - Traffic routing and load balancing
  - Observability and tracing
  - Circuit breaker patterns

# Auto-scaling
horizontal_pod_autoscaling:
  - CPU-based scaling
  - Memory-based scaling
  - Custom metrics (queue length)
  - Predictive scaling

# Storage
persistent_volumes:
  - PostgreSQL: SSD storage classes
  - Redis: Memory-optimized instances
  - InfluxDB: Time-series optimized storage
```

This enhanced architecture provides:

1. **Complete Visibility**: Every interaction is tracked and analyzed in real-time
2. **Proactive Intervention**: ML-powered risk scoring identifies at-risk candidates automatically
3. **Seamless Human Takeover**: Operators can intervene without losing context
4. **Scalable Foundation**: Microservices architecture supports growth
5. **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

The event-driven design ensures all components stay synchronized while maintaining loose coupling, and the multi-database approach optimizes for different data access patterns.
